After almost 10 years in the fun and energetic Motorcycle Industry, I decided to take a hobby to the next level and attend Flatiron School's Sofware Engineering Immersive program where I was met with a heaps of new challenges. I completed the program and created projects that I am very proud of. Flatiron instilled in me a love for programming and problem solving that I would like to share with everyone! I am a father, husband, and lover of family time video games."
